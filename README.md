# CSCE-310 Final Project - Crowdsourced TAMU Course and Professer Feedback Website

  This project was completed as the final project of my CSCE-310, Database Systems, course in conjunction with Adam Sulemanji, Yuning Zhang and Rohit Shankar.

  Our website allows is similar to RateMyProfessor in that it would allow for verified students of TexasA&M University to leave comments and reviews on professors or courses that they have had/taken during their time at TAMU. The website has seperate sign-ons for professors, admins and students that allow them different functionalities.
  
This project utilized the MAMP Pro software allowing us to use Apache to host our webiste, MySQL for the backend database with PHPmyAdmin for database management and PHP for communication between the backend database and the HTML/CSS frontend.
